# Physics Ball Drop - Flutter Game Prototype

A hyper-casual physics puzzle game where players drop a ball from the top of the screen and guide it to reach a goal by rotating obstacles.

## Features Implemented

### 🎮 Core Game Mechanics
- **Physics-based ball movement** with gravity, bounce, and friction
- **7 Different obstacle types** with unique behaviors:
  - 🟢 **Normal** - Rotatable green obstacles
  - 🔴 **Static** - Fixed red obstacles that can't rotate
  - 🌀 **Rotating** - Purple obstacles that auto-rotate continuously
  - 🧲 **Magnet** - Blue obstacles that attract the ball
  - 🌊 **Trampoline** - Cyan obstacles with enhanced bounce
  - ❄️ **Ice** - White obstacles that remove friction
  - 🔥 **Lava** - Orange obstacles that cause instant failure

### 🎯 Game Progression
- **12 handcrafted levels** with increasing difficulty
- **Infinite procedurally generated levels** beyond level 12
- **Progress tracking** with local storage
- **Score system** based on attempts vs. par

### 🎨 Visual Features
- **Gradient backgrounds** matching the design specification
- **Particle effects** for success/failure states
- **Ball trail effect** showing movement history
- **Glowing and pulsing effects** for special obstacles
- **Grid overlay pattern** for visual depth

### 📱 Mobile-Optimized UI
- **Portrait orientation** layout (400x600)
- **Touch controls** for obstacle rotation
- **Animated buttons** with gradient effects
- **Game state overlays** (pause, level complete, game over)
- **Legend showing obstacle types** with icons

## Technical Implementation

### 🔧 Technology Stack
- **Flutter** - Cross-platform mobile framework
- **Flame Engine** - 2D game engine for Flutter
- **Forge2D** - Physics simulation (Box2D port)
- **Provider** - State management
- **SharedPreferences** - Local data persistence

### 🎯 Physics System
- Realistic ball physics with customizable properties
- Collision detection between ball and obstacles
- Special effects for different obstacle types
- Smooth rotation animations for interactive obstacles

### 💾 Save System
- Automatic progress saving after each level
- High scores and attempt tracking

- Support for level unlocking progression

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Game Controls

- **Tap obstacles** to rotate them 45 degrees
- **Tap DROP button** to release the ball
- **Tap Reset button** to restart current level

## Level Design

The game includes 12 carefully designed levels:

1. **Levels 1-2** - Tutorial introduction to basic mechanics
2. **Levels 3-5** - Introduction of special obstacle types
3. **Levels 6-8** - Multi-obstacle combinations
4. **Levels 9-10** - Complex physics interactions
5. **Levels 11-12** - Master challenges requiring precision

Beyond level 12, the game generates infinite procedural levels with increasing difficulty.

## Performance Features

- Optimized for 60 FPS on mobile devices
- Particle system with configurable limits
- Efficient physics body management
- Memory-conscious component lifecycle

## Future Enhancements

- Sound effects and background music
- More visual effects and animations
- Additional obstacle types
- Multi-ball mechanics
- Level editor
- Online leaderboards
